As a data analyst for the Solar Dehydrator DCH project, I collaborated with a team to design a prototype that uses solar panels, Arduino, and a Fresnel lens to dehydrate food efficiently. My primary responsibility was to analyze and interpret solar irradiance data, ensuring the system's effectiveness. I performed data cleaning, handled outliers, and used statistical methods such as Q-Q plots and the Central Limit Theorem to validate the system's performance. The project demonstrated that the dehydrator could reliably dry food with a high degree of confidence, supported by thorough data analysis.
