As a Machine Learning Researcher for SmartDrive, I worked on developing a system to detect driver fatigue using computer vision. The project involved conducting literature reviews to identify state-of-the-art techniques, collecting and preprocessing sensor data from depth and thermal cameras, and implementing algorithms such as PERCLOS, Head Pose Estimation, and Eye Gaze Estimation. The resulting system provided a robust framework for real-time fatigue detection in drivers, contributing to safer road environments.
