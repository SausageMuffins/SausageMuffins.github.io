This project focused on sentiment and entity analysis in informal text, such as tweets, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). I designed and tuned a machine learning system that experimented with various smoothing methods, resulting in a remarkable ~240% improvement in F scores for Spanish-language sentiment detection. The project also emphasized best practices in developing machine learning frameworks, including cross-validation and model selection for optimal results.
