This project, titled "No Pain, Just Gain," focused on improving human posture estimation using computer vision. We implemented and trained Google's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10204" target="_blank">BlazePose</a> model with TensorFlow, then experimented with architectural modifications to boost the Percentage of Correct Key-points (PCK) scores. By integrating <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06521" target="_blank">Convolutional Block Attention Modules</a> (CBAM), we enhanced the model's intermediate feature representations, resulting in more accurate and robust pose estimation.
