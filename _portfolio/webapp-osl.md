This software engineering project involved designing and building a web application for SUTDâ€™s Office of Student Life. The application leveraged Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as Cognito, API Gateway, and serverless Lambda Functions for deployment. We adopted a hybrid Incremental and Iterative methodology, following Agile principles and documenting the process with Unified Modeling Language diagrams. Rigorous unit, integration, and system testing achieved over 90% backend coverage using Jest. The project also integrated AWS and GitHub for CI/CD and database management, resulting in a robust and scalable solution for student life operations.
