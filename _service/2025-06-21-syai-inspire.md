### My Role:
I participated as a facilitator in the monthly (June) meet-up session for Singapore Youth AI. This was one of the larger scale events that I volunteered in, with over 40 participants from diverse backgrounds. 

### What Happened?
In this event, I facilitated discussions about societal AI and how it could help students and/or vulnerable groups. It was very refreshing to listen to new perspectives of youths from different stages in life: Junior College, Polytechnic, servicemen currently serving their National Service, and even PhD students. They also shared why they became interested in AI which reminded me of my own motivations for pursuing research in this field. 

The second segment of this session involved a lot of vibe coding, to which I let the participants take over my laptop and let them "code". It was certainly very impressive how cursor could plan and execute in the creation of a resume roasting web app.

### What I found value in:
More importantly, I was able to **connect youths to different opportunities and/or things that they might be interested in** (e.g. one guy became really interested in physics-informed machine learning after an extended conversation about the different variants of machine learning); This is a very important cause to me, one that I hope to continue to assist others in realizing their interests!
