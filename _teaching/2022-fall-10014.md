I was an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the Freshmore module [10.015 Computational Thinking & Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/10-014-computational-thinking-for-design/){:target="_blank"}. This is an introductory course for Freshmores to learn python and visual programming.

- Taught small groups (4-5 per group) of students in the 10.014 Computational Thinking for Design module.
- Graded home assignments and lab work (programming a Raspberry Pi microcontroller) and maintained student records.
- Assisted faculty with the preparation of 20 unique questions for upcoming classes that test students on their coding (Python) abilities - search algorithms, functions and object-oriented programming questions.
