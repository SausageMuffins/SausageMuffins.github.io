Hi! My friends either call me Yuriel or Ryan, and I recently graduated with a BEng (Honours with Highest Distinction) in Computer Science from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I'm also an incoming MEng (Research) student this Fall, again with SUTD, supported by the AI Singapore Accelerated Masters Program. 

Currently, most of my time is invested in research centered on **Multimodal Collaborative AI**: the ways in which multimodal models could collaborate with humans (and non-humans) to work towards shared goals. Outside of research, I volunteer at [Singapore Youth AI](https://www.sgyouthai.org/){:target="_blank"} as a subcommittee member to connect youths to potential opportunities and learn more about AI.
